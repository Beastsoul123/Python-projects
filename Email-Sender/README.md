# Python Email Sender

This repository contains a simple Python script that sends an email using the Gmail SMTP server. It utilizes the `smtplib` and `ssl` libraries to securely send emails. The script also uses the `EmailMessage` class from the `email` module to construct the email message.

## Features

- Send emails using Gmail SMTP server.
- Securely login with SSL/TLS encryption.
- Simple and easy-to-understand Python script.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed.
- Access to a Gmail account.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-email-sender.git
   cd python-email-sender
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   The script uses built-in Python libraries, so no additional installations are required.

3. **Set up your email credentials:**

   Create a file named `app2.py` in the same directory as your script and add the following content:

   ```python
   password = 'your-email-password'
   ```

   Replace `'your-email-password'` with your Gmail account password. **Note:** It's recommended to use an app-specific password if you have 2FA enabled.

4. **Edit the script:**

   Open the script and set the `email_reciever` variable to the recipient's email address.

   ```python
   email_reciever = 'recipient@example.com'
   ```

5. **Run the script:**

   Execute the script with Python:

   ```bash
   python email_sender.py
   ```

## Code Explanation

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Imports necessary libraries:**
   - `EmailMessage` from `email.message` to create the email message.
   - `ssl` for creating a secure connection.
   - `smtplib` for sending the email.

2. **Define email parameters:**
   - `email_sender`: Sender's email address.
   - `email_password`: Sender's email password (imported from `app2.py`).
   - `email_reciever`: Recipient's email address.
   - `subject`: Subject of the email.
   - `body`: Body of the email.

3. **Create the email message:**
   - Use `EmailMessage` to set the sender, receiver, subject, and body.

4. **Establish a secure connection:**
   - Use `ssl.create_default_context()` to create a secure SSL context.

5. **Send the email:**
   - Login to the SMTP server using `smtp.login()`.
   - Send the email using `smtp.sendmail()`.

## Security Notes

- Do not hard-code sensitive information such as passwords directly in your script.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults to manage sensitive data.
- If using a Gmail account, consider setting up an app-specific password for better security.
